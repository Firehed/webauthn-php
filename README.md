## What is Web Authentication?
Web Authentication, frequently referenced as `WebAuthn`, is a set of technologies and APIs to provide user authentication using modern cryptography.
Instead of passwords and hashing, WebAuthn allows users to generate encryption keypairs, provide the public key to the server, and authenticate by signing server-generated challenges using the private key that never leaves their possession.

This means that servers _never touch sensitive data_ and _cannot leak authentication information_ should a breach ever occur.
This also means that users do not have to manage passwords for individual websites, and can instead rely on tools provided by operating systems, browsers, and hardware security keys.

## Using this library: A Crash Course

This will cover the basic workflows for integrating this library to your web application.
Classes referenced in the examples may omit the `Firehed\WebAuthn` namespace prefix for brevity.

### Sample Code
There's a complete set of working examples in the [`examples`](examples) directory.
Application logic is kept to a bare minimum in order to highlight the most important workflow steps.

### Setup

Create a `RelyingParty` instance.
This **MUST** match the complete origin that users will interact with; e.g. `https://login.example.com:1337`.
The protocol is always required; the port must only be present if using a non-standard port and must be excluded for standard ports.

```php
$rp = new RelyingParty('https://www.example.com');
```

Important: WebAuthn will only work in a "secure context".
This means that the domain MUST run over `https`, with a sole exception for `localhost`.
See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts for more info.

### Registering a WebAuthn credential to a user

This step takes place either when a user is first registering, or later on to supplement or replace their password.

1) Create an endpoint that will return a new, random Challenge.
This may be stored in a user's session or equivalent; it needs to be kept statefully server-side.
Send it to the user as base64.

```php
<?php

use Firehed\WebAuthn\ExpiringChallenge;

// Generate challenge
$challenge = ExpiringChallenge::withLifetime(120);

// Store server-side; adjust to your app's needs
session_start();
$_SESSION['webauthn_challenge'] = $challenge;

// Send to user
header('Content-type: application/json');
echo json_encode($challenge->getBase64());
```

2) In client Javascript code, read the challege and provide it to the WebAuthn APIs.
You will also need the registering user's identifier and some sort of username

```javascript
// See https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-sample-registration for a more annotated example

if (!window.PublicKeyCredential) {
    // Browser does not support WebAuthn. Exit and fall back to another flow.
    return
}

// This comes from your app/database, fetch call, etc. Depending on your app's
// workflow, the user may or may not have a password (which isn't relevant to WebAuthn).
const userInfo = {
    name: 'Username', // chosen name or email, doesn't really matter
    id: 'abc123', // any unique id is fine; uuid or PK is preferable
}

const response = await fetch('/readmeRegisterStep1.php')
const challengeB64 = await response.json()
const challenge = atob(challengeB64) // base64-decode

const createOptions = {
    publicKey: {
        rp: {
            name: 'My website',
        },
        user: {
            name: userInfo.name,
            displayName: 'User Name',
            id: Uint8Array.from(userInfo.id, c => c.charCodeAt(0)),
        },
        challenge: Uint8Array.from(challenge, c => c.charCodeAt(0)),
        pubKeyCredParams: [
            {
                alg: -7, // ES256
                type: "public-key",
            },
        ],
    },
    attestation: 'direct',
}

// Call the WebAuthn browser API and get the response. This may throw, which you
// should handle. Example: user cancels or never interacts with the device.
const credential = await navigator.credentials.create(createOptions)

// Format the credential to send to the server. This must match the format
// handed by the ResponseParser class. The formatting code below can be used
// without modification.
const dataForResponseParser = {
    rawId: Array.from(new Uint8Array(credential.rawId)),
    type: credential.type,
    attestationObject: Array.from(new Uint8Array(credential.response.attestationObject)),
    clientDataJSON: Array.from(new Uint8Array(credential.response.clientDataJSON)),
}

// Send this to your endpoint - adjust to your needs.
const request = new Request('/readmeRegisterStep3.php', {
    body: JSON.stringify(dataForResponseParser),
    headers: {
        'Content-type': 'application/json',
    },
    method: 'POST',
})
const result = await fetch(request)
// handle result, update user with status if desired.
```

3) Parse and verify the response and, if successful, associate with the user.

```php
<?php

use Firehed\WebAuthn\{
    Codecs,
    ResponseParser,
};

$json = file_get_contents('php://input');
$data = json_decode($json, true);

$parser = new ResponseParser();
$createResponse = $parser->parseCreateResponse($data);

$rp = $valueFromSetup; // e.g. $psr11Container->get(RelyingParty::class);
$challenge = $_SESSION['webauthn_challenge'];

try {
    $credential = $createResponse->verify($challenge, $rp);
} catch (Throwable) {
    // Verification failed. Send an error to the user?
    header('HTTP/1.1 403 Unauthorized');
    return;
}

// Store the credential associated with the authenticated user. This is
// incredibly application-specific. Below is a sample table.
/*
CREATE TABLE user_credentials (
    id text PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id text,
    credential text,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
*/

$codec = new Codecs\Credential();
$encodedCredential = $codec->encode($credential);
$pdo = getDatabaseConnection();
$stmt = $pdo->prepare('INSERT INTO user_credentials (id, user_id, credential) VALUES (:id, :user_id, :encoded);');
$result = $stmt->execute([
    'id' => $credential->getStorageId(),
    'user_id' => $user->getId(), // $user comes from your authn process
    'encoded' => $encodedCredential,
]);

// Continue with normal application flow, error handling, etc.
header('HTTP/1.1 200 OK');
```

4) There is no step 4. The verified credential is now stored and associated with the user!

### Authenticating a user with an existing WebAuthn credential

Note: this workflow may be a little different if supporting [passkeys](https://developer.apple.com/passkeys/).
Updated samples will follow.

Before starting, you will need to collect the username or id of the user trying to authenticate, and retreive the user info from storage.
This assumes the same schema from the previous Registration example.

1) Create an endpoint that will return a Challenge and any credentials associated with the authenticating user:

```php
<?php

use Firehed\WebAuthn\{
    Codecs,
    ExpiringChallenge,
};

session_start();

$pdo = getDatabaseConnection();
$user = getUserByName($pdo, $_POST['username']);
if ($user === null) {
    header('HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found');
    return;
}
$_SESSION['authenticating_user_id'] = $user['id'];

// See examples/functions.php for how this works
$credentialContainer = getCredentialsForUserId($pdo, $user['id']);

$challenge = ExpiringChallenge::withLifetime(120);
$_SESSION['webauthn_challenge'] = $challenge;

// Send to user
header('Content-type: application/json');
echo json_encode([
    'challengeB64' => $challenge->getBase64(),
    'credential_ids' => $credentialContainer->getBase64Ids(),
]);
```

2) In client Javascript code, read the data from above and provide it to the WebAuthn APIs.

```javascript
// Get this from a form, etc.
const username = document.getElementById('username').value

// This can be any format you want, as long as it works with the above code
const response = await fetch('/readmeLoginStep1.php', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: 'username=' + username,
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8',
    },
})

const data = await response.json()

// Format for WebAuthn API
const getOptions = {
    publicKey: {
        challenge: Uint8Array.from(atob(data.challengeB64), c => c.charCodeAt(0)),
        allowCredentials: data.credential_ids.map(id => ({
            id: Uint8Array.from(atob(id), c => c.charCodeAt(0)),
            type: 'public-key',
        }))
    },
}

// Similar to registration step 2

// Call the WebAuthn browser API and get the response. This may throw, which you
// should handle. Example: user cancels or never interacts with the device.
const credential = await navigator.credentials.get(getOptions)

// Format the credential to send to the server. This must match the format
// handed by the ResponseParser class. The formatting code below can be used
// without modification.
const dataForResponseParser = {
    rawId: Array.from(new Uint8Array(credential.rawId)),
    type: credential.type,
    authenticatorData: Array.from(new Uint8Array(credential.response.authenticatorData)),
    clientDataJSON: Array.from(new Uint8Array(credential.response.clientDataJSON)),
    signature: Array.from(new Uint8Array(credential.response.signature)),
    userHandle: Array.from(new Uint8Array(credential.response.userHandle)),
}

// Send this to your endpoint - adjust to your needs.
const request = new Request('/readmeLoginStep3.php', {
    body: JSON.stringify(dataForResponseParser),
    headers: {
        'Content-type': 'application/json',
    },
    method: 'POST',
})
const result = await fetch(request)
// handle result - if it went ok, perform any client needs to finish auth process
```

3) Parse and verify the response. If successful, update the credential & finish app login process.

```php
<?php

use Firehed\WebAuthn\{
    Codecs,
    ResponseParser,
};

session_start();

$json = file_get_contents('php://input');
$data = json_decode($json, true);

$parser = new ResponseParser();
$getResponse = $parser->parseGetResponse($data);

$rp = $valueFromSetup; // e.g. $psr11Container->get(RelyingParty::class);
$challenge = $_SESSION['webauthn_challenge'];

$credentialContainer = getCredentialsForUserId($pdo, $_SESSION['authenticating_user_id']);

try {
    $updatedCredential = $getResponse->verify($challenge, $rp, $credentialContainer);
} catch (Throwable) {
    // Verification failed. Send an error to the user?
    header('HTTP/1.1 403 Unauthorized');
    return;
}
// Update the credential
$codec = new Codecs\Credential();
$encodedCredential = $codec->encode($updatedCredential);
$stmt = $pdo->prepare('UPDATE user_credentials SET credential = :encoded WHERE id = :id AND user_id = :user_id');
$result = $stmt->execute([
    'id' => $updatedCredential->getStorageId(),
    'user_id' => $_SESSION['authenticating_user_id'],
    'encoded' => $encodedCredential,
]);

header('HTTP/1.1 200 OK');
// Send back whatever your webapp needs to finish authentication
```

## Best Practices

### Data Handling

Use the _exact data format_ shown in the examples above (`dataForResponseParser`) and use the `ResponseParser` class to process them.
Those wire formats are covered by semantic versioning and guaranteed to not have breaking changes outside of a major version.

Similarly, for data storage, the output of `Codecs\Credential::encode()` are also covered.

Challenges generated by your server SHOULD expire after a short amount of time.
You MAY use the `ExpiringChallenge` class for convenience (e.g. `$challenge = ExpiringChallenge::withLifetime(60);`), which will throw an exception if the specified expiration window has been exceeded.
It is RECOMMENDED that your javascript code uses the `timeout` setting (denoted in milliseconds) and matches the server-side challenge expiration, give or take a few seconds.
Note: the W3C specification recommends a timeout in the range of 15-120 seconds.

### Error Handling

The library is built around a "fail loudly" principle.
During both the registration and authentication process, if an exception is not thrown it means that the process succeeded.
Be prepared to catch and handle these exceptions.
All exceptions thrown by the library implement `Firehed\WebAuthn\Errors\WebAuthnErrorInterface`, so if you want to only catch library errors (or test for them in a generic error handler), use that interface.

### Registration & Credential Storage

- Credentials SHOULD have a 1-to-many relationship with users; i.e. a user should be able to have more than one associated Credential
- The credential id SHOULD be unique.
  If during registration this unique constraint is violated AND it's associated with a different user, your application MUST handle this situation, either by returning an error or de-associating the credential with the other user.
  See https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-2/#sctn-registering-a-new-credential section 7.1 step 22 for more info.
- The WebAuthn spec makes no guarnatees about the maximum credential id length, though none were observed to be over 64 bytes (raw binary) during library development.
  It is RECOMMENDED to permit storage of up to 255 bytes, as this tends to be the most compact variable-length encoding in many databases.
- The credential SHOULD be stored as a string encoded by `Codecs\Credential::encode()`, and decoded with `::decode`.
  The storage system must allow for values up to 64KiB (65,535 bytes) of ASCII; the encoding will not contain values out of the base64 range.
- It's RECOMMENDED to allow users to provide a name associated with their credentials (e.g. "work laptop", "backup fido key").

### Authentication

- The `verify()` method called during authentication returns an updated credential.
  Your application SHOULD update the persisted value each time this happens.
  Doing so increases security, as it improves the ability to detect and act on replay attacks.

## Versioning and Backwards Compatibility

This library follows Semantic Versioning.
Note that classes or methods marked as `@internal` are NOT covered by the same guarantees.
Anything intended explicitly for public use has been marked with `@api`.
If there are any unclear areas, please file an issue.

There are additional notes in Best Practices / Data Handling around this.

## Resources and Errata

This library is a rework of [`u2f-php`](https://github.com/Firehed/u2f-php), which is built around a much earlier version of the spec known as U2F, pioneered by YubiCo with their YubiKey products.
WebAuthn continues to support YubiKeys (and other U2F devices), as does this library.
Instead of building a v2 of that library, a clean break was found to be easier:

- There's no need to deal with moving the Composer package (the u2f name no longer makes sense)
- A lot of the data storage mechanisms needed to be significantly reworked
- The platform extensibility in WebAuthn did not translate well to the previous structures
- Dropping support for older PHP versions & using new features simplified a lot
