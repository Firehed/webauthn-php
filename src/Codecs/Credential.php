/**
 * This codec is responsible for serializing a CredentialInterface object to
 * and unserializing from a binary-safe string for storage and retreival.
 *
 * Client applications SHOULD NOT attempt to manually encode or decode
 * credentials. The encoded representation of a credential SHOULD be treated as
 * an opaque string without inspection or modification. This library makes
 * the following promises:
 *
 * - The opaque strings will not be outside of the base64 character range
 * (A-Za-z0-9/+=)
 * - The opaque strings are versioned, and if a new version is introduced,
 * there will be an upgrade/conversion path
 * - The opaque strings will not exceed 64KiB (65535 bytes)
 *
 * Client applications must adhere to the following guidelines:
 * - The opaque strings must be stored without modification
 *   - Do not change case
 *   - Do not trim or truncate any bytes
 * - If the opaque strings are stored in a database, the data type must hold at
 * least 64KiB (note: this is intentionally the size of TEXT column in MySQL)
 * - Storage of opaque strings must ensure a byte-for-byte roundtrip after
 * accounting for connection and storage encoding. This is a low-risk area for
 * the base64 character set, by design.
 *
 *
 * The format spec is for internal use only.
 *
 * Format spec:
 *
 * A CredentialObj shall be encoded to a string.
 * That string shall be a base64-encoded representation of:
 *
 * [ version ] [ version-specific data ]
 *
 * version shall be a single byte.
 * The highest bit (big-endian) shall be 0.
 * A high bit of 1 is reserve for future use, and if encountered, an error
 * should be thrown.
 * The lowest seven bits shall be interpreted as a big-endian7-bit integer.
 *
 * The remainder of the string is a variable-length value that is specific to
 * the version.
